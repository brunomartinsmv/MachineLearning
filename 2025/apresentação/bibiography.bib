  abstract = {The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) method, established in 1951, has since evolved into a pivotal tool in data mining, recommendation systems, and Internet of Things (IoT), among other areas. This paper presents a comprehensive review and performance analysis of modifications made to enhance the exact kNN techniques, particularly focusing on kNN Search and kNN Join for high-dimensional data. We delve deep into 31 kNN search methods and 12 kNN join methods, providing a methodological overview and analytical insight into each, emphasizing their strengths, limitations, and applicability. An important feature of our study is the provision of the source code for each of the kNN methods discussed, fostering ease of experimentation and comparative analysis for readers. Motivated by the rising significance of kNN in high-dimensional spaces and a recognized gap in comprehensive surveys on exact kNN techniques, our work seeks to bridge this gap. Additionally, we outline existing challenges and present potential directions for future research in the domain of kNN techniques, offering a holistic guide that amalgamates, compares, and dissects existing methodologies in a coherent manner.},
